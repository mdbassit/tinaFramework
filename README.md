tinaFramework
=============

tinaFramework stands for This Is Not A Framework, and like it's name implies, it's not a full-fledged PHP framework, 
but rather a simple MVC skeleton I've been using and enhancing for years, and now I've decided to release it to the 
public.


Features
========

 - Lightweight
 - Easy to setup and use
 - Database abstraction layer
 - Dedicated HTTP request class
 - Dedicated session class
 - Template support

And more to come soon...
